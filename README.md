# SudokuSolver

A small GUI application that can create random valid sudokus and solve them.

It's also possible to create your own by writing your own numbers in the fields and press "Lock in" 
be sure to atleast have a total of 17 numbers to prevent the GUI to lock for a long time.

There is still some work to be done, Example:
* Some timelimit if the solve takes too long.
* Check gives wrong answer
